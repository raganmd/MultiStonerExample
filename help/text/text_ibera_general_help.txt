ESTEROS DEL IBERA

Welcome to the Ibera!

The beginning part of this project has been set up to help
get you started. In the UI you'll see a number of various 
elements to help make your process easier.

Starting on the "Mapping" tab, you can see fast access buttons
to determine the projector output:

Display Index - to ensure your displays are setup correctly
Calibration - a simple calibration plate
Test Media - this displays media loaded from the Test Media Tab
Live Input - a placeholder for the live show yet to be developed

Warping Controls allow you fast access to key stoning and grid
warping controls for the output from each projector.

Save Maps - This will save all the displacement maps from any
grid warping or key-stoning you've done. This saves an entire
tox located in the project folder:

ibera\calibration_tox\base_calibration_data

The Previs tab allows for a fast virtual mode view of the content
as it should be broken up across the installation.

The Test tab is where you can load test media.

The Show tab is where your UI elements might go.

The Debug tab has a simple performance monitor, you might consider
adding additional elements here to help you debug the network.Don't 
forget to be mindful of how these elements might impact your
project's performance
